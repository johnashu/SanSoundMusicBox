# SAN Music Box and Sanctuary/Rebirth Contracts.

# Summary

On March 10th, SAN will launch a SAN Music Box NFT minter. 

The SAN Music Box NFT will act as a governance token and an identifier for claiming the SAN Character NFT on March 21st.

There will be three ways to get a music box: 

1. Soulbind an existing SAN Origin NFT to receive a Legendary SAN Music Box NFT

2. Send three SAN Origin NFTs to the Sanctuary receive a Rare SAN Music Box NFT

3. Send a Scout SAN Origin NFT to the Sanctuary, which requires one SAN Origin NFT and an accompanying partner NFT (0N1 Force, Mutant Apes, WoW, Etc), for a common SAN Music Box NFT.


# Three methods for Minting a Music Box 

1. Those with soulbound SAN Origin NFTs (SBSON) will do nothing but claim. The SAN Music Box NFT minter will read for SBSON and deliver 1 SAN Music Box NFT for every 1 SBSON.


2. Select three SAN Origin NFTs to ‘send to the Sanctuary’.The contract will burn the three SAN Origin NFTs and rebirth them in the sanctuary collection. NFTs that are rebirthed in the sanctuary contract cannot be removed from the owner wallet in any way; however, they can be soulbound to levels 1-4, as per the specifications in the SAN Origin NFT contact. Upon sending three SAN Origin NFTs to the sanctuary, an additional token is minted to the owners wallet: a SAN Music Box NFT.


3. Sending a Scout to the sanctuary is the same as the second method but one partner NFT counts as two SAN Origin NFTs and the one partner NFT is not burnt, whereas the one SAN Origin NFT is burnt and rebirthed in the sanctuary. Upon sending one SAN Origin NFT to the sanctuary, an additional token is minted to the owners wallet: a SAN Music Box NFT.


* rebirth collection -  unbound becomes bound - burn San origin, mint new rebirth.  

* basically musicbox will mint 3 x rebirth and 1 x mb nft

* 1 state in new contract = SoulBound (Merged). Then 1-4 levels.

* MusicBox standalone - act of merging, takes 3 rebirth to mint musicbox nft, fully tradable.. standard NFT.
  
* Rebirth will be the only address that can mint MusicBox NFT's.

* Fees can be changed

* Only Merged NFT's from orign are allowed - level 0 only
  
1. Soulbind **3 San Orgin** NFT's that are at level 0 in the origin to create a new NFT** SMB (MusicBox) ** Token and *Rebirth* 3 New Tokens in the *Sanctuary*. Soulbinding does not give access - state 1 = Merged.  
   
2. Can transfer when Merged but not after that level.
   
3. Any level can be paid for can upgrade but cannot downgrade
  
* Once in a Soulbound state, the NFT acts as the holder’s token-gated login to the SAN Sound platform:


* Merged will not receive access to the SAN Sound platform.
* Citizen will receive one year of access to the SAN Sound platform. .33 ETH
* Defiant will receive LIFETIME access to the SAN Sound platform.    xxETH
* Hanzoku will receive LIFETIME access to the SAN Sound platform.  xxETH
